# An application based around cross-country city comparison (CCCC), leveraging the BDX NewHomeSource Web API. The application takes in cities as input from the user. It returns ng2-chart (chart.js) graphs depicting comparisons between different metrics, such as price per square foot, quick move-in percentage (QMI), and the percentage of communities with different facets (ie. pool, views, etc.). It was developed during my time as a software engineering intern at ZondaHome.
